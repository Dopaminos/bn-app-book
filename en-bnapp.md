Obligatory: Everything in this document is based on my past experiences applying and hearing about my friend’s applications (and some experiences from doing evaluations this year). This does not reflect the thoughts and opinions of the NAT, nor does it reflect on how I do my evaluations as a part of NAT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you want to apply to be a Beatmap Nominator?? (BN (big noob)). But the application process is confusing, you don’t know what the NAT overlords want from your app, and reading the rejection feedback from either yours or your friend’s applications is demotivating?  \
 \
This document will be my best attempt to outline what are some ways you can increase your chances. Note that this is meant to be used as reference, and is definitely not a surefire guide or bible to success. Take everything with a grain of salt and most importantly **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">use your own brain to think.</span>**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step 1: Mapping Knowledge</span>**

Before you can mod, you obviously need mapping knowledge. You can’t identify issues without knowing what are issues in the first place. You can’t give suggestions for improvements without knowing how to map well.

How much mapping knowledge do you need? Well, thankfully not a lot. You don’t need to be the best damn mapper in the world, but you need at bare minimum a solid foundation. Of course, the better you are at mapping, the more complex the maps you can tackle, and the better the suggestions you give are. (If you’re only good at mapping standard BPM anime maps, you’re going to struggle modding a map of a complex electronic song).

Here’s a quick litmus test:

 \
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do you have a ranked map? If not, is it due to lack of trying?</span> \
If you have been trying to push a map to rank but failing due to various reasons especially map quality, **Give up **(for now)**.** Go learn to map first.

If you’re just lazy, or not very interested in the process, then you may be a mapping sandbagger! Though I’d still recommend you try the ranking process out once so you get a feel of what you need to do as a BN, or just to familiarise yourself with the modding process.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Look at these maps.</span>

 \
If you thought these maps were half-decent, **Give up **(for now)**.** Go back to learning mapping. You’re not good enough yet.

_(I intentionally only used my own maps because I don’t want to offend anyone. If you felt that me roasting my own maps was indirectly roasting you, then well at least you know the issue now.)_

Seriously. If you think these are passable just don’t even try. You’ll probably miss out a million non-unrankable issues or just give awful suggestions. Expand your mapping knowledge more, and soon you’ll realise how cringe the above linked maps are.

How do you know when you are a good enough mapper? Well, I couldn’t tell you, this is rather subjective. Some of you may think you’re already good enough, but all I’ll say is, a good rule of thumb is: If you mapped something, left it alone for a week, come back to it and can instantly start spotting areas to improve on in your own map, then you’re probably ready to try for BN. Not foolproof but a good start.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Have you mapped any low difficulties before?</span>

If yes, have you tried to rank them? If you do low diff GDs and constantly get general posts, you might wanna revisit the “learning how to map” thing.

If you rarely map low difficulties, try one. Get someone you know that is experienced at low diffs for feedback. If you get roasted, back to Step 1.

If you’re comfortable with low difficulties, then you may proceed.

Too many modders flunk their low diff modding, either due to just not knowing how to handle them, or thinking stuff is unrankable when it’s not. A good solid base for all difficulty ranges is important.

Alright, so now you’re equipped with the knowledge to start your modding journey to become a ~~big noob~~ beatmap nominator. Let’s get into what kind of mods you should submit to showcase your skills! \
 \
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step 2: Modding</span>**

Disclaimer: go mod a few maps and hit the kudosu requirement (duh). Like don’t expect to 1 try bare minimum modding experience and get into BNG. It’s really rare and usually doesn’t end well.

So now that you have modded more than a handful of maps before and are looking to submit some maps for your application? But what do the NATs want to see? Everyone’s telling you different things and you’re not quite sure. The bullet points on the website aren’t very helpful either.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42616718/211783203-f79237a2-99d4-467e-9da6-1c98fdd59070.png)


However, you should absolutely keep these bullet points in mind. I will go on to the next section assuming you know about the above.

Firstly, before you mod a map, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">SAVE THE DAMN .OSZ FILE.</span>**

Submit the .osz file when you submit your application. This helps us verify your mods and avoid misunderstanding. Plus, if the mapper adds another int after you modded, we can be sure that you didn’t miss it. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Doing this only increases your chances.</span> So do it. 

Now, let’s look for maps. Typically, you might expect, or have someone told you “pick a newbie map! That way you can show off how much you know about unrankables and other overarching general issues”

(next page)

It depends. If I see this:



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42616718/211783415-175d9519-2ddc-49da-927c-0cad769b467c.png)



And each post has like 50 lines of text you probably need a new map.

Why?

First of all, a newbie map with that many general issues is probably just a map that is too far from ranked. This doesn’t help you at all because



1. The issues are too obvious, we don’t care if you can find them. 
2. If you **MISS** anything or explain something wrongly on a map with obvious issues like this, it reflects badly on you.

So yea, why would you EVER use a map like this? There is no gain and only potential negatives.

A better idea would be to find a map of someone that knows basic mapping stuff already such as emphasis and the such, but is having trouble executing on it or lacks experience. These are the maps where to a player it looks like “a map” but to a modder it should look like juicy points to attack. That would make your first mod to submit. Try to look for general issues and areas to improve on for these mappers, there’ll usually be plenty. Don’t skip on the timeline issues either, being able to suggest an isolated improvement to a pattern or idea can showcase your depth of knowledge and perspective.

Your 2nd mod to submit should be on a map that **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">you will nominate.</span>** When you apply for BN, they’ll ask you if you would nominate that particular map with reasons. Include at least 1 map that you will nominate so we know your quality standards.

But wait, if you would nominate the map, doesn’t that mean you think the map is good? What’s there to mod about it?

(next page)

This is where the tricky part comes. You see, Beatmap Nominators primarily deal with maps they will nominate. That's close to the only types of maps they’ll mod once they become a BN. So you should definitely include one of these in your application. BNs also have to mod the maps they nominate, so if you’re struggling to mod a map that you feel like you would nominate, either find a new map or **git gud.** You might not be ready yet. Or you may have just stumbled upon a super clean mapper. In that case, try again somewhere else.

Alright so that’s 2 of your mods down. What do you do for the third? \
 \
Refer to the bullet points on the website. Look through your mods, and make sure you check every box. If you are missing any of them, submit your third mod to fill the holes. Your third mod should follow the same guidelines as the first 2, i.e don’t use a newbie map, don’t use a map where you can’t post anything on it. The point is to fill up content that you missed, not create more opportunities for you to blunder.

Now, let’s get into the actual **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">modding mindset</span>**. 

Firstly, when you look for maps for mod, be it sniping others’ queues or from your own queues, **mod with the intent to improve the map.** If you see a map and are only modding it to post stuff that looks good on an app instead of trying to improve the map then **fix your brain**. 

Modding should help the mapper, so the mods you submit should <span style="text-decoration:underline;">clearly give solutions for the mapper to improve on their maps</span>. Based on what you identify as issues or areas for improvements, of course. Rule of thumb is, your mods should always contain a **Problem** (The issue/area to improve), a **Reason** (why is it a problem/why can it be better), and a **Solution** (How should the mapper resolve the issue/what is the improvement to be made here). 

If you submit a mod just solely pointing out every flaw in the map and then leave w/o giving concrete solutions, you’re definitely going to fail. And also, a lot of mappers won’t take you seriously either.

(next page)

That clears up the **Solution** part of modding, now onto the **Reason**.

Mappers won’t take you seriously if you are unable to provide strong reasons to back up your suggestions. You need to convince the mapper that what you are suggesting is better for the map. (Mappers intention also comes to play here but I won’t go in depth, if you don’t understand what that is go mod more maps and gain experience.) \


So how do you have good reasons? Let me start by telling you 2 things to **NOT** do.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do not copy a general mod format and just paste it.</span>

No, don’t give me that “I have a few concerns about the contrast between sections…” “rhythms here are too dense but in kiai the rhythms are more sparse…” “spacing large blah blah blah lack of contrast...” \
 \
I will slap you figuratively. **Understand what you are writing.** Don’t just copy other wallmods and slap new timestamps onto them.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEVER use the word consistency.</span>

You don’t know what that means. Don’t use it. Too many new modders see an issue, don’t know what to write for the reason so they just say “do xxx to be consistent”.

 \
First of all, that makes no sense. Consistency should be a comparison. Secondly, most people say “make xxx consistent to yyy”. Are you SURE xxx and yyy should be similar? Don’t pull a comparison out of your ass if those 2 parts aren’t even supposed to be similar anyway.

The safest way is; just drop the term. Use other words to describe. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If consistency really was the problem there are other ways to describe it.</span> Dropping this term will force you to think about the actual root cause of the issue rather than defaulting to a term that you use wrongly. 

(next page)

It is not feasible for me to get into every little case of how to provide strong reasons for your suggestions. I couldn’t possibly cover everything, so instead I’ll give you a general piece of advice.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Explain yourself in the shortest, most concise way.</span>**

No, I don't need to see you write 30 paragraphs and use 201734832 different buzzwords to explain why this spacing is bad. Explain it **simply**. If you cannot mod using simple terms, then do you really understand what you are suggesting, or are you just vomiting random mapping terms without knowing what they mean just to sound smart?

_Here is where I would include a list of funny as fuck terms I’ve seen other people use but to keep this document impartial and not be toxic I shall not list them._

Alright, so we dealt with **Solutions**, and we have also dealt with **Reasons**. All that’s left is **Problem**. How do you identify issues or areas for improvements? \
.

.

.

.

.

Just learn to map lmfao. This is why mapping knowledge is important. Without it you cannot identify issues because of course you can’t. Note that the amount of mapping knowledge you need depends on two things:

The more complex the concepts and ideas in the map, the more knowledge you need.

The more knowledge you have, the better the suggestions you will be able to give, as well as being able to spot more areas for subjective improvements, even on simpler maps.

In short: \
**To be good at modding, you shouldn’t give up on your mapping. Improve both concurrently.**

(next page)

If you give up mapping to focus on modding, even if you do have the baseline knowledge, you will forever be stuck as a 1 trick and only be able to mod simple maps properly. 

You don’t _need_ the extra knowledge to be BN, it is very common for BNs to specialise (aka, only proficient at modding a subset of maps, thus they only nominate such maps). It is up to you whether you want to stay at that level once you get BN, or you want to constantly chase improvement.

EDIT: I decided I want to include one more short paragraph of advice.

Other than hunting for issues in the map to point out, you should also try to look for things that aren't issues, but that you think could have been done better (while respecting the mapper's ideas). This is the "Areas for subjective improvement" I pointed out throughout the document. It'll reflect really well on you if you can do this consistently, since it shows you are genuinely trying to mod a map to improve it, even on subjective things.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will end this document by telling you one last piece of advice: \


**Don’t be an idiot in public or semi-public spaces.**

Evaluations have a “Behaviour” section. If we’re on the fence on a decision, this may be the tipping point for you. Of course, if your behaviour is consistently bad then yea GLHF you’re probably pseudo-blacklisted.

Good luck to all applicants, may 2023 be your year! Hope to see new faces in the BNG soon!
